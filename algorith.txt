ALGORITHM: Movement Detection and SMS Alert System

1. Initialize System
   - Power ON ESP32
   - Initialize MPU6050
   - Set GPS = OFF
   - Set GSM = OFF
   - Store initial orientation and acceleration baseline
   - Store reference GPS coordinates (if available)

2. Monitoring Mode
   - Continuously read MPU6050 tilt and acceleration data
   - Compare with predefined movement thresholds

3. If Movement Detected
   - Start 10-second delay (stabilization period)

4. After 10 Seconds
   - Power ON GPS module
   - Read current GPS coordinates

5. Compare Location
   - Calculate distance between current and reference coordinates
   - If distance exceeds allowed threshold:
       → Power ON GSM module
       → Send SMS with new location

6. After SMS Sent Successfully
   - Power OFF GSM module
   - Power OFF GPS module

7. Return to Monitoring Mode
   - Repeat from Step 2
